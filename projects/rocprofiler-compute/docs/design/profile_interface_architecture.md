# Profile Interface Architecture

Status: proposal

This document describes the architecture for profile data storage and access in
rocprofiler-compute, and records the decisions made in the design review so the
reasoning behind them is not lost. The goal is to keep storage-format knowledge
in one place behind a clear boundary, so ROCPD, profiler-hub, parquet, or any
future source can be added as a single implementation instead of forcing
profiling, analysis, CLI, TUI, WebUI, and utility code to change with it.

## Problem

Profile data storage is becoming more varied:

- ROCPD `.db` is becoming the default and canonical profile output.
- The native tool writes counter data directly into a SQLite/ROCPD database via
  profiler-hub.
- Parquet is a possible future option for large workloads.

Today the writing, reading, joining, and pivoting of profile data are thinly
spread across many modules. On-disk file names are hardcoded in multiple places,
and the same modules mix csv joins, rocpd extraction, and analysis expectations.
Every new storage format therefore touches many unrelated modules, which raises
the cost and risk of each change.

There is also a concrete performance motivation. On large (AI) workloads,
profile and analyze time were dominated by redundant reads, writes, and pivots
of intermediate CSVs over millions of rows. Removing those intermediates and
going straight to an in-memory frame is a primary driver of this work.

## Goal

Put PMC profile data storage behind one boundary with a clear reader and writer
contract:

- Profile mode finalizes data through a **writer**.
- Analyze mode reads data through a **reader** that returns the in-memory frame.
- No other module knows whether the source is ROCPD, profiler-hub, or a future
  format, and no other module knows where or how it is stored on disk.

Adding a new storage format should mean adding one implementation behind the
boundary and extending one selection point — not editing profiling, analysis,
and utility code.

## Architectural Decisions (AD)

Each decision below is recorded with its rationale and consequences

### AD-1: Remove the CSV profile backend

The CSV profile *output format* is removed end to end and rocpd becomes the
canonical profile source. This covers both halves of the CSV backend: the
profile-side path that chose and wrote csv, and the analyze-side path that read
csv-shaped workload directories (the `format_rocprof_output` selection in
`join_prof` that merged `results_pmc_perf_*.csv` / `SQ_*.csv` / `SQC_*.csv`).
As a consequence, workload directories produced by the old csv output format are
no longer analyzable by a current release; users who need to analyze those use an
older rocprof-compute release. The `results_*.csv` intermediate that the rocpd
path still emits is removed later with the reader boundary (AD-3), not here.
Backward compatibility for ROCm versions older than 7.0 (which come before rocpd
support) is _intentionally_ not carried forward in profile or analyze mode.

Keeping csv forces two parallel storage implementations with
different dependencies, requires "not supported in CSV" warnings to be sprinkled
across every new feature, and increases the complexity the boundary must
abstract. Also csv to rocpd is a lossy conversion so a back conversion is not a real
substitute for native rocpd.

Users on ROCm < 7.0 use an older rocprof-compute
release to profile and analyze those workloads; a new release is not expected to
analyze data produced by an old, unsupported profiler and also we have a deprecation notice. IF a hard CSV requirement ever returns, the
boundary makes it cheap to add back as one implementation.

### AD-2: Remove the rocprofv3 backend so rocprofiler-sdk is the lone backend

Counter collection is ultimately performed by the SDK tool in
both cases, so v3 only adds a redundant script layer. The csv-shaped *analysis*
handling is tied to the csv output format, not to v3, so it is removed earlier in
Phase A with the CSV backend (AD-1); what remains for this decision is the
rocprofv3 script layer and any v3-specific output shaping.

Removing v3 deletes the redundant script layer and its v3-specific handling. This
is planned in the backend phase (Phase C) together with the inheritance cleanup
in AD-5 because it is a backend execution concern rather than a
profile-data-storage concern.

### AD-3: `pmc_perf.csv` is no longer in the analyze read path

Analyze mode does not read `pmc_perf.csv` anymore, for example instead of going results_*.csv -> pmc_perf.csv -> pandas df we go straight from profile output -> pandas dataframe in memory, basically the reader returns the
pmc DataFrame built directly from the profile source. `pmc_perf.csv` becomes a
**one-way export** (which is written but not read back), so it stays exactly as available
as it is today for users, developers, and tests, nothing in current behavior or
the test suite changes and the file still appears on every analyze run.

Currently, EVERY analyze run materializes `pmc_perf.csv` and then
reads it back, so all profile formats collapse through a CSV regardless of how
they were stored which basically defeats the point of supporting varied storage and adds
large csv pivot cost on big workloads. Any output format reader is forced to also
produce a CSV just so analyze can read it (e.g. rocpd is `.db` -> `results_*.csv`
-> `pmc_perf.csv` -> frame). With `read_pmc_frame` any profile output returns a
frame directly and never round-trips through CSV. `pmc_perf.csv` is an
intermediate not a public contract, so analyze should not depend on it.

The merged frame depends on the user's **analysis filters**,
so a one time materialize and reuse does not work. The reader builds
the frame from source **per analysis run** with filters applied in memory and
the `pmc_perf.csv` export is derived from that frame.

Making the export itself optional/opt-in, so users who do not need it do not pay
the cost of producing it on large workloads, is a deferred follow-up and not part
of this change.

### AD-4: One profiler backend, modeled as a single entity

rocprofiler-sdk is the only backend, modeled as a single cohesive
profiler entity rather than a base class with one subclass. No separate
orchestration/collector layer is introduced.

With one backend there is nothing to abstract across, so a single
entity is simpler and if a second collector is
added later for whatever reason, an interface can be extracted at that point.

### BOUNDARIES in these ADs to mention:
#### Unit tests do not touch disk

Disk I/O lives behind a thin, transparent adapter (like 
header/row write primitives) that is intentionally left untested. Unit tests
mock the writer/reader and assert on what is passed rather than writing or
reading real files.

Tests that write to disk leave stray artifacts when they crash,
can exhaust CI storage, and depend on system resources. The boundary makes
disk free testing natural as in the same writer interface that production uses is
swapped for an in memory fake in tests

#### No pandas in profiling

Already discussed at length and merged to current develop pipline, this boundary has to be respected in this design as well as in profiling code must not depend on pandas or other analysis only
dependencies. The boundary exposes a **writer** used by
profiling (pandas-free) and a **reader** used by analysis (pandas is fine here), packaged
together but with different dependency characteristics.

Profiling and analysis have different runtime constraints and leaking
heavy analysis dependencies into the profile path is not acceptable. Removing the
csv profile backend (AD-1) makes this cleaner by deleting the profile-side
v3->v2 csv conversion handling; profiling is already pandas free, since the
remaining csv I/O uses the stdlib `utils_profile_csv.py` helper rather than
pandas.

## Phasing and Acceptance

Phase order: A (remove CSV) -> B (`profiling_data` boundary) -> C (backend
execution) -> D (`analysis_data` boundary), plus follow-ups (e.g. A-2, removing
the now-dead `--join-type` option). Once Phase A lands, B, C, and D have no hard
ordering dependency on each other.

## Phase A: Remove the CSV Profile Backend

CSV removal comes first because it shrinks everything downstream: there is no
second storage format to hide behind the boundary, and profiling stays
pandas free. This phase does not introduce the boundary yet it just deletes the
CSV profile *output format* and the code it dragged in; rocpd becomes the sole
profile output format.

Removed in this phase:

- the `if csv` branch in `utils_profile.py` and the csv-only conversion helpers
  it relied on (`process_rocprofv3_output`, `v3_counter_csv_to_v2_csv`,
  `convert_native_counter_collection_csv`, `process_kokkos_trace_output`),
- the `--format-rocprof-output` flag and the rocpd->csv fallback, so profile mode
  no longer chooses a storage format,
- the analyze-side csv-format path in `join_prof` (the `format_rocprof_output`
  selection and the `results_pmc_perf_*.csv` / `SQ_*.csv` / `SQC_*.csv` wide
  merge, with its `join_type` / `kokkos_trace` reads and `SQ_ACCUM_PREV_HIRES`
  rename), so analyze no longer supports csv-shaped workload directories. The
  rocpd `results_*.csv` concat that builds `pmc_perf.csv` is unchanged.

Intentionally **kept** in this phase (they move in Phase B):

- `results_*.csv`. The rocpd path still converts each `.db` into `results_*.csv`,
  and analyze still reads `results_*.csv` through the rocpd concat path. Removing
  it requires analyze to read the frame directly from `.db`, which is the reader
  contract introduced in Phase B (AD-3).
- `utils_profile_csv.py`. It is the stdlib (pandas-free) csv helper used by the
  rocpd path (`results_*.csv`, counter-collection csv), `sysinfo.csv`, and
  marker-trace augmentation. It is not pandas-dependent; it is what keeps these
  writes pandas free. It shrinks and goes away as those csv intermediates are
  eliminated in later phases.

Phase A deletes the csv format choice and the csv-format analyze branch, but
keeps the rocpd read path (`results_*.csv` -> `pmc_perf.csv`). Moving analyze off
`results_*.csv` / `pmc_perf.csv` to read `.db` directly is Phase B.

```

On the data path the structural change is small: the `if csv` branch, the
`csv-only conversion helpers` node, and the `--format-rocprof-output` flag go
away, so profile mode no longer chooses a storage format, while `results_*.csv`
and `utils_profile_csv.py` remain (their removal and analyze reading directly
from `.db` is Phase B). On the analyze side the format-specific join
(`joins (format specific)` in the Before diagram) collapses to a plain rocpd
`reads` of `results_*.csv`, since the csv-format merge branch is removed with the
backend. That is why the Before and Target diagrams look nearly identical: these
are *data-flow* diagrams, and both backends already fed the same `results_*.csv`,
so deleting the csv backend only drops a single branch on each side.

The diff is much larger than the diagram suggests because most of what is removed
does not live on the data-flow path: the deleted code is *inside* the boxes
(helper bodies in `utils_profile.py`), and the bulk is *tests*, which are not part
of the runtime flow. Removing the format choice includes removing:

- the v3->v2 csv conversion and the kokkos / native-counter csv shaping helpers
  in `utils_profile.py`, plus the now-unused pandas-style helpers pruned from
  `utils_profile_csv.py` (~800 deletions of profile-side code),
- the analyze-side csv-format branch in `analysis_base.join_prof` and its unit
  coverage (e.g. the `SQ_ACCUM_PREV_HIRES` rename test in
  `test_analyze_commands.py`),
- the test coverage for all of the above, which is the bulk of it (~2k deletions
  across `test_utils.py`, `test_utils_profile_csv.py`, and the profile tests).

So Phase A is a small *path* change but a large *code* deletion where it collapses two
storage formats into one and removes the dead csv machinery (and its tests) that
only existed to serve the second format.

### What removing `--format-rocprof-output` does and does not change

Removing the `--format-rocprof-output` flag removes the user's ability to
*choose* a storage format; it does not remove the recorded format. Profile mode
still writes `format_rocprof_output: rocpd` into `profiling_config.yaml`, now
sourced from a single `_PROFILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT` constant instead of a CLI value.
This is deliberate and forward-aligned with the boundary:

- It is the discriminator analyze uses to reject legacy csv workload directories
  (`format_rocprof_output: csv`) with a clear error instead of misreading them as
  rocpd.
- It is the field Phase B's `get_reader` keys on to select a reader
  implementation (see [Data Ownership](#data-ownership): `profiling_config.yaml`
  is *read* by `get_reader` to select the impl, it is not owned data).

Centralizing the value in `_PROFILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT` keeps the `"rocpd"` literal
out of the call sites that read and write it (no scattered magic strings). So
`format_rocprof_output: rocpd` is expected to stay in newly written workload
configs, and `_PROFILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT` stays. The two committed csv-format test
fixtures (`vcopy/MI350`, `no_roof/MI350`) are intentionally left as legacy
workloads that analyze now rejects.

### Phase A-2: Remove the now-dead `--join-type` option

`--join-type {kernel,grid}` only ever fed the csv-format wide merge in
`join_prof` (it chose whether rocprof runs joined by kernel name or by kernel
name + grid size). With that merge removed in Phase A the flag is dead: nothing
in `src/` reads it, and `grid` vs `kernel` now produce identical output. It
survives only as an orphaned CLI flag in `argparser.py`, still serialized into
`profiling_config.yaml` via `vars(args)`.

Removing it is a small follow-up to Phase A rather than part of the csv-output
removal itself, because it also deletes user-facing surface, the dedicated
`join_type_grid` / `join_type_kernel` golden workloads, their integration tests,
and the `--join-type` references in the profile-mode docs. Tracked here so the
cleanup is not lost: remove the flag, its golden workloads and tests, and its
doc references.

## Phase B: The Profiling Data Boundary

The boundary owns where PMC profile source data lives and how it is read/written, and exposes two contracts:

- `ProfilingDataWriter.finalize_pass(context)` which records a completed profiling
  pass at the end of profile mode (pandas free)
- `ProfilingDataReader.read_pmc_frame(workload_dir, filters)` which returns the pmc
  df built from source for its respective analysis run
- `ProfilingDataReader.has_profile_data(workload_dir)` which reports whether readable
  profile data exists so callers stop string matching for specific and hardcoded file names.

Callers obtain an implementation through selection functions rather than
constructing implementations directly:

- `get_reader(profiling_config, options)` returns the correct reader.
- `get_writer(format)` returns the correct writer.

This is the only place that maps a configured format to an implementation.

```

The reader reads its storage implementation, normalizes source specific rows into
the PMC DataFrame, applies the analysis filters in memory, and returns the frame.
Analyze callers never branch on storage format, construct file paths, or read
`pmc_perf.csv`.

## Phase C: Backend Execution

Backend execution which controls command construction, environment setup, attach/detach,
subprocess execution, and pass finalization is separate from profile data
storage. This phase removes rocprofv3 (AD-2) and merges the backend into a
single profiler entity.

Today `profiler_base` is a base class with `rocprof_v3_profiler` and
`rocprofiler_sdk_profiler` as subclasses, and the bulk of execution lives in a
very large `run_prof` function. With v3 gone there is a single backend, so the
two are merged into one cohesive profiler entity that finalizes each pass through
the writer from Phase B.

## Phase D: Analyze-Data Boundary

The boundary above covers profile *source* data. Analyze mode also produces its
own derived files (`pmc_kernel_top.csv`, `pmc_dispatch_info.csv`, roofline HTML,
text reports, the analysis export `.db`), and today each is written with a
hardcoded name in the code that produces it — and the same names are hardcoded
again on the read-back side. This deserves its own boundary so analyze-output
location and format knowledge does not spread the way profile-data knowledge did.

`analysis_data/` is symmetric with `profiling_data/`: `profiling_data/` owns
where profile *source* data lives; `analysis_data/` owns where analyze-*derived*
outputs go. It is a writer/reader for derived outputs not a storage format
implementation.

## Data Ownership

Not every file in a workload directory is profile data. Keeping the boundary
intact means classifying each file by owner.

| Class | Examples | Owner | Behind the profiling-data boundary? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw profile source data (PMC) | ROCPD `.db`, future parquet | `profiling_data/implementations/` | **Yes** — only the boundary knows the layout and conversion rules |
| Removed legacy profile data | `results_*.csv` | — (removed in Phase B, AD-3) | n/a |
| Exported artifact | `pmc_perf.csv` | `ProfilingDataReader` export (AD-3) | **Write-only** — derived from the in-memory frame and written every analyze run; never read back; not a public contract. Making production opt-in is a follow-up |
| Profile-time non-PMC data | `roofline.csv` (empirical ceilings) | roofline / SoC code | No — not PMC counters |
| Profile metadata / config | `profiling_config.yaml`, `sysinfo.csv`, `perfmon/pmc_perf_*.yaml` | Profile mode | No — `profiling_config.yaml` is *read* by `get_reader` to select the impl, but is not owned data |
| Trace data | `*_marker_api_trace.csv`, `torch_trace_*.csv`, PC sampling json | Profile / trace code | No — out of scope |
| Derived analyze artifacts | `pmc_kernel_top.csv`, `pmc_dispatch_info.csv`, roofline HTML, text report, analysis export `.db` | `analysis_data/` (Phase D) | No — separate boundary |

## Testing Architecture (AD-6)

- Unit tests must not read or write the real filesystem.
- Disk serialization sits behind a thin adapter (e.g. write-header / write-row
  primitives) that is intentionally transparent and left uncovered, because it is
  just a passthrough to a third-party library or the filesystem.
- The writer/reader contracts are mocked in unit tests; tests assert on what the
  model passed to the writer (rows, headers, finalize calls) rather than
  inspecting files.
- Only the thin disk adapters and end-to-end / integration tests touch disk.
- Refactoring the boundary will require updating existing unit tests that
  currently write scratch files; this is expected.

## Known Gaps

These remain after the boundary lands; they do not block it.

1. Post-pass profiling work (application replay, the roofline benchmark) runs
   after the counter passes complete. The writer's finalize step must accommodate
   this phase, or it is explicitly a backend concern outside the data boundary;
   to be confirmed in Phase C.
2. PC-sampling analyze reads JSON produced by profile mode. That is another
   format that should eventually sit behind a similar boundary (likely a JSON
   implementation); noted for future scope.

## Success Criteria

The design is working when:

- Profile mode cannot produce, and analyze mode cannot read, the legacy csv
  output format; rocpd is the only profile source (Phase A)
- Profile mode does not decide or know the storage layout, and does not depend on
  pandas
- Analyze mode can ask for a pmc DataFrame without knowing what the source is and without reading `pmc_perf.csv`.
- `pmc_perf.csv` is written as a one-way export derived per run, and analyze no
  longer reads it back. This saves a lot of csv processing especially on large workloads.
- Workload availability checks go through `has_profile_data()` rather than probing
  for specific files
- Storage-format conditionals are isolated to `get_reader` / `get_writer` and the
  implementations
- Adding a new profile source primarily means adding one implementation and
  extending selection in one place (high locality of change)
- The boundary can be exercised in unit tests without touching disk
